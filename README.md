Software Product Lines Chatter app server and client

# Building & Testing
We use the idea build system for now.
- `Build / Build Artifacts` will build the .jar's so you can run them from command line.
- You can also use the inbuilt buttons to start a server from the `ChatServer` and `ChatClient` classes
- The jars are in the `out/artifacts directory`
- `java -jar Server.jar` should run server, idea downloads the jdks to `~/.jdks/` so you can also run it as `~/.jdks/.../bin/java -jar Server.jar`
