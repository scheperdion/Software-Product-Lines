Software Product Lines Chatter app server and client

# Building & Testing
We use the idea build system for now.
- `Build / Build Artifacts` will build the .jar's so you can run them from command line.
- You can also use the inbuilt buttons to start a server from the `ChatServer` and `ChatClient` classes
