\section{Context/Background}
For the course software product lines we are developing a software product line. 

\section{Motivation}
% why is it a good idea to develop a product line / conduct your proposed project etc.)?
\begin{itemize}
	\item variability is 'easy' to find in this domain (a lot of weather variables).
	\item a MVP can be relatively easy to develop.
	\item the optional feature problem can be encountered because the weather properties themselves seem to be independent but may not be so when implemented
	\item the project is not dependent on external services, it is easy to mock weather data if a real source can not be found.
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}
% This question can entail a software development methodology (used processes for working in your team, tools etc.) and/or research methodology (empirical research, design science researchâ€¦)
\begin{itemize}
	\item agile / remote
	\item git / github for code sharing
	\item featureIDE
	\item optional: include aspectJ if possible
\end{itemize}

\section{Deliverables}
%For example, what features do you plan to implement, what kind of variability mechanisms will be used and why, etc.
